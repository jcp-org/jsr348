<h1>JCP.next JSR1 list of proposed changes </h1>
<p><em>Updated June 21 2011</em></p>
<p><em>Changes since last release</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Updated tasks</em></li>
  <li><em>Added Red/Yellow/Green color-coding </em> </li>
</ul>
<h2>Documents to be modified</h2>
<ul><li>The Process Document
    <ul>
      <li>Normative</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The EC Members' Guide
    <ul>
      <li>Create a normative <em>EC Standing Rules </em>document from
        Appendix A of the Process Document and the currently
        non-normative EC Members Guide.</li>
      <li>This will be referenced from the Process Doc and will address issues
        such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Meeting schedules, quorum requirements. </li>
          <li>Voting procedures. </li>
          <li>Publish EC meeting agenda in advance. </li>
          <li>Specify whether agenda items are for discussion or for action.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>NOTE: once created, this document will not require a new JSR to modify
        - instead this can be  by a vote of the ECs after a one-month review
        period. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Spec Lead Guide
    <ul>
      <li>Non-normative: referenced from Process Document</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedural issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>When will the changes in the Process Document take effect? </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The JSPA currently prohibits us from applying Process Document changes
          to JSRs that are in progress:
          <ul>
              <li>&quot;The Process is described on the JCP Web Site (at http:/jcp.org),
                and may be revised from time to time in accordance with terms
                set forth in the Process document, provided that no such revisions
                shall apply to any JSR that has already been approved for development.&quot; </li>
            <li>We may fix this in JSR2 but for now we'll need to apply <em>moral
                pressure</em> to in-flight JSRs to adopt the new procedures.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li><a href="#Cleanup">Cleanup</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Annotation Key </h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DONE:</strong> we have suggested wording, and we seem to have broad
    consensus. (This doesn't mean that we won't tweak it later - just that it
    seems to be good enough for EDR.)</li>
  <li><strong>IN PROGRESS :</strong> we have suggested wording, but do not yet
    have consensus and are still discussing.</li>
  <li><strong>WAITING:</strong> waiting for suggested wording.  </li>
  <li><strong>FURTHER CHANGE REQUIRED</strong>: we have a first draft, but it
  needs revision. </li>
  <li><strong>TBD</strong>: we haven't yet decided whether to include this item. </li>
  <li><strong>CANCELLED:</strong> we decided to drop this item.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span class="green"><strong>GREEN:</strong></span> OK for EDR </li>
  <li><strong class="yellow">YELLOW:</strong> On track for EDR</li>
  <li><strong class="red">RED</strong>: More discussion needed </li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Note that strictly speaking the change log does not list all changes
          "after Final Release" but only those since the previous release.
            We should therefore change "after Final Release" to "since
          the previous release."          </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recommendation</strong> - in the <em>Process

                    from the Spec Page that lists all changes made to the Specification
                    after Final Release. There are three sections: PROPOSED
                    (changes not yet made to the Specification), ACCEPTED (changes
                    made), and DEFERRED (change items to be considered in a

                    six sections: PROPOSED (changes not yet made to the Specification),
                    ACCEPTED (changes made to the Specification), DEFERRED (changes
                    to be considered in a new JSR) and RI (changes made to the

                <ul>
                  <li>The PMO will publish these lists on jcp.org (and will publicise

      <li><strong>Non-recommendations (reconsider these for JSR2)</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Do not publish lists of incompatible implementations. </li>
            <li>This is legally risky, and unnecessary (the list of incompatible

              implementations.)</li>
            <li>Do not (yet) publish information about optional features that

            </li>
            <li>Do not require more formal reporting requirements for conformance
              claims.
              <ul>
                <li>Would require generalizing compatibility requirements.</li>
