<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document describes proposed clarifications to the definitions of Membership
  within the Process Document. It is provided as a separate document in order
  to facilitiate the process of reviewing and providing comments within the issue-tracker.
  All comments on this document should be provided as comments to <a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR348-86">JSR348-86: </a><a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR348-86">Improve
  clarity of Member definition</a>. When we reach consensus, the agreed-upon changes will be documented
  in that and other issues as necessary. </p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Clarify the different classes of membership, and identify the rights, privileges,
  and restrictions associated with them. Where possible, insert language to prevent
  an organization from gaming the system by enrolling its employees as individual
  members. </p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p><strong>Agent</strong>: an individual - for example an employee, a contractor,
or an officer - who is authorized to act on behalf of a company or organization.</p>
<p>NOTE: JUG members are not Agents. </p>
<p><strong>Java Community Process Member (Member):</strong> A
  company, organization, or individual that has signed the JSPA and is abiding
  by its terms. In the case of an individual, that person may represent himself/herself,
or may be an Agent of a company or organization.</p>
<p>NOTE: do we need the second sentence? There's a third case - the individual
  member may be both representing their own interests and may also be an Agent
  of a company or organization. Moreover, if he/she is an Agent, the company
  or organization may or may not be a member. It would be better not to get into
  all of these complications... </p>
<p><strong>Member Representative</strong>: An Agent of a Member company or a
  Member organization who represents its interests within the JCP.</p>
<p>NOTE: there is no restriction on the number of Member Representatives from
  any company or organization. Member Representatives may join Expert Groups
  under the terms of the JSPA signed by the parent Member. </p>
<p>NOTE: as defined, a Member Representative may or may not be a Member in his/her
  own right. </p>
<p><strong>Member Associate</strong>: An individual who is assoicated with a
  Member organization but is not an Agent of that organization. </p>
<p>NOTE:  JUG members fall into this category. Current policy (unspecified in
  the Process Document) is that the PMO will require a signed Exhibit B before
  a Member Associate may join an Expert Group. However, this is legally insufficient,
  since such members are not and can not be bound by the JSPA signed by the parent
  organization. We really should require these people to join as individuals
  before allowing them to join an Expert Group. If we do so, then there's probably
  no need for this category of membership since strictly speaking it carries
  no privileges. </p>
<h2><strong>Restrictions</strong></h2>
<p>During earlier discussion we proposed the following restrictions:</p>
<p><em><strong>1) No more than three (or five) Agents of non-Members may join as individuals.</strong></em></p>
<p>On legal advice, we will need to postpone any such restriction until JSR3,
  when we modify the JSPA.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Individual Members who are also Agents of Member organizations
    do not get separate votes in elections; only the Member organization gets
  a vote.</strong></em></p>
<p>In section 6.4.2 ELECTION PROCESSES we should therefore say:</p>
<p> &quot;All JCP Members are eligible to vote in ballots for Ratified and Elected
  Seats subject to the provisions that if a Member has majority-ownership of
  one or more other Members, or if one or more Members are Agents of another
  Member, then that group of Members will collectively have one vote, which will
  be cast by the person they designate to be their representative for the ballot
in question.&quot; </p>
<p><em><strong>3) Individual Members who are also Agents of Member organizations
are not permitted to run in elections as individuals.</strong></em></p>
<p>In section 6.4.4 SELECTION PROCESS FOR ELECTED SEATS we should therefore say:</p>
<p>&quot;Any Member may nominate themselves except that Member Representatives
  who are also JCP Members in their own right cannot run for Elected Seats as
  individuals and the PMO shall reject such nominations.&quot;</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This is a complicated subject, and until we modify the JSPA we're limited
  in what we can do. The minimal changes discussed above are all I believe we
  should implement. </p>
