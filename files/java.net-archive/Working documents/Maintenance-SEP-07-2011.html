<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document describes proposed changes to the Final Release and Maintenance
  Release processes. It is provided as a separate document in order to facilitiate
  the process of reviewing and providing comments within the issue-tracker. All
  comments on this document should be provided as comments to <a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR348-70">JSR348-70:
  </a><a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR348-70">Simplify
  Maintenance Review process by eliminating Item Exception Ballot and Change
  Log</a>. </p>
<p>The contents of this document were agreed at the Working Group meeting on
  August 31, 2011. </p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goals of these proposed changes are  to simplify
  the Maintenance Release process by  eliminating the Item Exception Ballot
  and Change Log, to harmonize the Maintenance and regular Release processes,
  to ensure that Maintenance Release artifacts (updated Spec, RI, and TCK) are
  delivered within a reasonable (finite) time, and to ensure that the Maintenance
  Release process remains relatively light-weight. </p>
<p>In proposing changes we should recognize the
  fundamental differences between the JSR development and Maintenance processes:
  while the former is subject to strict scrutiny by the EC, and can be halted
  if the Spec Lead fails to satisfy the EC, in the latter case the Maintenance
  Lead is paramount, and the EC can do no more than indicate that
  a particular proposed change should be postponed to a follow-on JSR rather
  than being included in the Maintenance Release.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The Issue Tracker is the mechanism that will allow us to simplify the Maintenance
  Release process and to harmonize it with the JSR development process. A formal
  process for dealing with potential &quot;show-stopper&quot; issues will
  provide us with the equivalent of an Item Exception Ballot, and allow us to
  apply the same process to all ballots. </p>
<p>We already state that JSR ballots by EC members may be a  accompanied
  by comments. We should require that comments other than those of a general
  nature must explicitly reference Issues (maybe we should formally define
  this term.) So, for example, a member might vote 'no' with the comment &quot;I'm
  willing to change my vote to 'yes' if you deal with issue #17 to my satisfaction&quot; or
  alternatively, vote 'yes' with the comment &quot;if you don't address issue
  #17 to my satisfaction I'm going to have to vote 'no' at the next ballot. (Obviously,
  the EC member will in some cases need to log the Issue.) <br />
  <br />
The Public Review draft includes the following statements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;all
    open issues must be responded to publicly before the JSR moves to the next
  stage&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;EC members, when
    voting to approve a JSR's advance to the next stage, should take into consideration
    the EG's responses to comments, and may insist that a suggestion or issue the
  EG considers resolved be re-addressed before the JSR moves on.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>How can we implement these requirements in practice?</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Responding to&quot; an issue might be as simple as saying &quot;we think that's
    a dumb idea&quot; or &quot;we agree this is important and we'll address it later.&quot;
    Neither response is very helpful at the time it's given - only later will
    it become clear whether the issue has really been &quot;resolved.&quot;</li>
  <li>Does the second requirement require us to define an appeals process whereby
    issues deemed showstoppers are addressed to the satisfaction of the submitter?
    I think not... </li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever process we define cannot  allow one person  
  to mark an issue as a show-stopper and insist that the JSR be halted or the
  MR abandoned unless it's addressed - that would give everybody veto power,
  and lead to deadlock. Instead, we need to align this mechanism with the existing
voting process. </p>
<p>Do we need to do anything new, or can we simply provide a mechanism whereby
   issues can be flagged as problematic (in someone's opinion,) and  require
  that EC members take these (and all issues) into consideration when voting?
  I think we can, if we require that Spec and Maintenance Leads provide a
  list of issues and their disposition when submitting materials for review.
  This would encourage them to address issues in advance, and permit EC members
  to focus on potential problem areas.</p>
<p>If the list of&nbsp; issues is clearly visible to all, and EC members take
  it into consideration when voting, then we have the moral equivalent of an
  Item Exception process for all JSR ballots; if a majority of the relevant EC
  considers that one or more issues have't been dealt
  with appropriately they will vote 'no' and the Spec/Maintenance Lead will have
  to adjust the contents of the proposed Release until the EC is satisfied. </p>
<h2>Proposal</h2>
<h3><strong>New defined terms</strong></h3>
<p><em>Issue tracker</em>: define the requirements, including the different states/categories
  that can be associated with an Issue - don't specify the actual tool that should
  be used. 
  (We probably need to define a category indicating that an Issue the Spec Lead
  claims to have resolved has been 'challenged' or 'disputed' in order to flag
  this as something requiring special attention from the EC.)</p>
<p><em>Issue</em>: an explicit reference to an item defined in an <em>Issue
Tracker</em><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Issue List</em>: a list of all Issues that have
  been logged against the current Release, summarizing the EG's response to (disposition
  of) each. The Issue List must clearly
  specify  all items that will be fixed in the proposed Release and those that
  have been deferred to a future Release. These and other categories of Issue
  (such as Issues the EG has closed as &quot;non-issues&quot;) are specified in the definition
  of <em>Issue
  Tracker. </em><em></em></p>
<p><em>Maintenance Renewal Ballot</em>: a ballot during which EC members vote
  on whether to permit a Maintenance Lead to extend the deadline for delivery
  of materials for Maintenance Release, or whether the previous Maintenance Review
  should be &quot;rescinded&quot; and
  the ML be required to start the process again. [Note: this is analogous to
  the <em>JSR Renewal Ballot</em>  that we've currently
  defined, but it's probably easier to define a new term than to generalize the
  other definition and process.]</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>When a Spec Lead or a Maintenance Lead submits materials for a JSR ballot
  they must provide an Issue List for EC members' consideration.</p>
<p>EC members must review the supplied Issue list and take it into consideration
  when casting their ballot. If they have any reservations or concerns about
  a 'yes' vote, or if they wish to vote 'no' they should accompany their ballot
  with comments which reference Issues (perhaps logged by them) that they
  would like to see addressed. </p>
<p>For example, during a JSR development ballot a
  member might vote 'no' with the comment &quot;I'm
  willing to change my vote to 'yes' if you deal with issue #17 to my satisfaction&quot; or
  alternatively, vote 'yes' with the comment &quot;if you don't address issue
  #17 to my satisfaction I'm will vote 'no' at the next ballot. Similarly,
  during a Maintenance Review ballot an EC member might vote 'no' with the
  comment &quot;the change proposed in issue #17 is not appropriate for a Maintenance
  Release and should be deferred to a follow-on JSR.&quot; </p>
<p>EC members should vote
  'no' if they believe that the SL/ML has
  not adequately addressed all outstanding Issues.  (Issues logged during the
  ballot process itself would either be addressed in a later Release
  submission, or if not, lead to a future 'no' vote.) </p>
<p>When  materials are delivered to the PMO for a Maintenance Review the ML must
  provide an estimate of when the final materials will be delivered for the Maintenance
  Release. If no estimate is provided the deadline will default to 30 days.
  EG members should take this estimate into consideration when voting, and may
  vote 'no' if they consider the proposed Release date too far in the future.
  (EC members should bear in mind that many Maintenance Releases need to
  be synchronized with updates to a Platform, and that a Maintenance Review may
  therefore need to be carried out signinficantly in advance of the propsed Release.) </p>
<p>NOTE: need to define a process for the PMO to gather information from SL/ML
  and pass it on to the EC for consideration during the ballot. </p>
<p>If the Maintenance Lead fails to deliver the final materials as promised,
  a Maintenance Renewal Ballot will be held to determine whether the deadline
  may be extended or whether the previous Maintenance Review should
  be &quot;rescinded&quot; and the ML required to go through another Maintenance
  Review/. </p>
<p>Maintenance
  Releases are different from regular Releases in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 'no'
  votes may only be cast for one of the following reasons - 'no' votes with
  any other justifcation will be rejected by the PMO
    <ul>
      <li>an item the ML included in the list of proposed changes
        should be deferred to a follow-on JSR.</li>
      <li>the proposed date for
        the delivery of Maintenance Release materials is unreasonably far in
        the future.</li>
      <li>a change in license terms is unacceptable .</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the ML can enter the Maintenance
    Review process any number of times. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>Differences from current process:</p>
<p>No need for an Item Exception Ballot process.</p>
<p>No need for a Change Log (replaced by an Issue List.) Note, however, that
  we added requirements that the Change Log should also indicate changes to the
  license, the RI, and the TCK. These will now have to be provided to the PMO
  in an alternate form. </p>
<p>A majority of no votes will halt an MR even if each references a different
  issue. This is different from the current Item Exception process, but should
  be just as effective. The ML will adjust the contents and can come back as
  many times as they like until a majority is achieved. So, we're not looking
  for a majority to oppose an individual change (as we did with the Item Exception
  Ballot) but rather for a majority to oppose going forward because they believe
  that possibly different changes are inappropriate. This is a subtle change,
  but doesn't appear harmful. </p>
<p>If an ML fails to deliver the final materials within a 'reasonable' time the
  EC can vote to 'rescind' the previous Maintenance Review and require the ML
  to start the Maintenance Review process again. </p>
