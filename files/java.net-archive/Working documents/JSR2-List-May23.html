<h2><a name="Transparency" id="Transparency"></a>Transparency</h2>
<h3>Expert Group transparency </h3>
<ul><li>Eliminate confidentiality language from the JSPA.
    <ul>
      <li>We have draft language (from the JSR 306 draft)</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Executive Committee transparency </h3>
<ul>
  <li>(Overflow from JSR1 if necessary.)
</ul>

  <li><strong>Changes discussed but not incorporated into JSR1</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Publish lists of incompatible implementations.
      <ul>
          <li>This is legally risky, and unnecessary (the list of incompatible
            implementations can be derived from the list of compatible implementations.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Publish information about optional features that are implemented.
      <ul>
          <li>This would be difficult to implement (what level of granularity
            would we choose?)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Strengthen the TCK quality requirements
      <ul>
          <li>Before we do, make sure we're effectively policing existing requirements</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Require more formal reporting requirements for conformance claims.
      <ul>
          <li>Would require generalizing compatibility requirements.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>IP flow transparency</h3>
<ul>
  <li>(Overflow from JSR1 if necessary.) </li>

          specs in public forums.</li>
        <li>A simple membership agreement for those who want voting privileges
          and the right to serve on Expert Groups.</li>
        <li>The complexities of IP and compatibility obligations are
          required only for Spec Leads &ndash; factor these out into
          a separate agreement.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
<h2><a name="Agility" id="Agility"></a>Agility</h2>
  <ul><li>&nbsp;Enable implementations before specs are finalized, to gain

            <ul>
              <li>The &quot;it will become one&quot; addition is new
                - need to revise the existing language. </li>
            </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="IPflow" id="IPflow"></a>IP flow </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-assertion patent covenant.
      <ul>
        <li>We have draft language. Patrick to circulate this and ask
          people to get their lawyers to comment </li>
        <li>May need to add wording to ensure that the non-assert promise transfers
          with IP ownership. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Should people be permitted to withdraw their
        IP grants? At any time?
      <ul>
        <li>JSPA Section 4D D. <em>Withdrawal of Contributions due to Change
            in Announced License Terms</em> says Yes. </li>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fix potential issues with <em>JSPA Exhibit B</em>.

        <li>Others should feel free to offer suggestions. </li>
        <li>Clarify what is a &quot;duly authorized representative of Employer.&quot;
          <ul>
            <li>Replace &quot;Employer&quot; with &quot;Assignee&quot;</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Implementation issues:
          <ul>
            <li>People change employers
              <ul>
                <li>Require individuals to &quot;re-confirm&quot; their membership
                  each year and at that point to confirm that the Exhibit
                  B is still valid or submit a new one.</li>
                <li>PMO to require a current Exhibit B whenever an individual
                  (or someone associated with a group where there is
                  not an employer-employee relationship joins an EG.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What about members of groups where there is no employer
              relationship?
              <ul>
                <li>Eg JUG, research institution, university, open source
                  community.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Licensing" id="Licensing"></a>Licensing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Define a mandatory standard Spec License.
      <ul>
        <li>TODO: Patrick to circulate the &quot;recommended&quot; Spec

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Recommend (but do not require) standard RI and TCK licenses.
      <ul>
        <li>Provide separate templates for Independent (open source)
          and commercial implementors.</li>
        <li>TODO: Patrick to circulate examples for discussion </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
<h2><a name="LegalIssues" id="LegalIssues"></a>Legal issues </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Clarifiy the JSPA as discussed within
      the EC.
      <ul>
        <li>Members will be asked to sign the new/revised JSPA (resulting
          from JSR2) - some may insist on this clarification at that
          point.</li>
        <li>Modified JSPA should not grant rights to one player that
          others don't have. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Address the issue of where litigation should be located. California,
      or elsewhere?
      <ul>
        <li>California is an obstacle to Brazilian state involvement. </li>
        <li>According to Java Champion Douglas Jenssen this is also an
          issue within the US. He has said in private mail:
          &quot;The issue is a legal one, where do legal disputes between
          Sun/Oracle and a member -- whether individual, sponsored by
          his employer, or corporation -- get litigated. When I last
          met with the JCP, the answer was it has to be in California.
          No public institution such as a state university is going to
          agree to that, and many corporations will not agree either.
          Hence I was told there are no members from public universities,
          only from private ones that choose to agree.&quot;</li>
        <li>The JSPA says: &quot;Any action related to this Agreement
          will be governed by California law, excluding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_of_law">choice
            of law rules</a>, provided, however that neither party has
          consented to the jurisdiction of any court located in the
          other party&acute;s country
          of incorporation.&quot;</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
  <h2><a name="Collaboration" id="Collaboration"></a>Collaboration</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Changes to make it easier to collaborate with other standards-setting
      organizations</li>
    <li>Incorporate the <em>Hybrid</em> and <em>Transplant</em> JSR proposals
      from JSR 306. .,
      <ul>
        <li><em>Transplant JSRs</em> (enable incorporation and standardization
          of work developed outside the JCP)</li>
        <li><em>Hybrid JSRs</em> (allowing non-Java implementations of a JSR's
          specification)</li>
      </ul>
</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a name="Fees" id="Fees"></a>Fee structure </h2>
  <ul><li>Modify cost structure (in JSPA) to permit PMO to charge a nominal fee
      for individuals if this should prove necessary.
    <ul>
      <li>Eg, &quot;fees for individuals are $250 per year... Fees may be waived
        at the discretion of the PMO.&quot;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Iincrease fees for commercial entities?</li>
    <li>Explicitly place JUGs in the same category as individuals.  </li>
  </ul>
<h2><a name="Cleanup" id="Cleanup"></a>Cleanup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Phase-out the IEPA provisions (no longer used.)
      <ul>
        <li>IEPA agreements never expire - we need to deal with this.</li>
        <li>Encourage existing IEPA members to &quot;resign&quot; or
          to become full members.
          <ul>
            <li>There aren't very many of them, so hopefully the PMO
              can handle this.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Remove references to IEPA from JSPA.
          <ul>
            <li>Need legal approval for this. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Clarify that a binary RI must be released by Spec Lead. </li>
  </ul>
<h2><a name="Other" id="Other"></a>Other</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Governance
    </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Create an <em>Architecture Council?</em>
        <ul>
          <li>Council would gather input from implementors, developers, and users
            and to provide guidance to Platform Expert Groups on platform evolution
            in the interests of maintaining competitiveness, compatibility and
            relevance. </li>
          <li>The membership of this group should be primarily technical,
            and it must operate by consensus and through negotiation with the
            Platform Spec Leads. </li>
          <li>Possible deliverables for the Council:
            <ul>
              <li>Yearly survey
                of the community</li>
              <li>Written responses to Platform JSRs.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedural issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>When will the changes in the JSPA take effect? </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>We can not require that an existing JSR be ruled by new version
          of the JSPA. </li>
        <li>Currently there is no requirement that members upgrade to the latest
          JSPA.
          <ul>
            <li>Note that section 2B uses the term &quot;expires&quot; but
              it seems there is no way for a JSPA to expire (merely &quot;terminate&quot;)
              - we should fix this,</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Will the new version be version 3 (containing significant legal
          changes?)
          <ul>
            <li>Presumably yes - otherwise why make the effort to modify it?</li>
            <li>If so, we want people to upgrade - all members should be operating
              under similar IP grants.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation: </strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Specify a lengthy transition period (two years?) with a common
              deadline, allowing ample time for review. </li>
            <li>All new JSRs must adopt the latest JSPA. This implies that
              the Spec Lead and EG members must sign it when the JSR is submitted. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>The JSPA also forbids us from applying changes to JSRs that are in-progress</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>&quot;The Process is described on the JCP Web Site (at http:/jcp.org),
          and may be revised from time to time in accordance with terms set
          forth in the Process document, provided that no such revisions shall
          apply to any JSR that has already been approved for development.&quot; </li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Modify this language to give us the power
                    to apply Process Doc changes to in-flight JSRs.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This wouldn't require us to do so, just make it possible
                        if we wish. </li>
                      <li>The language should specify that at the EC's discretion
                        some or all of the requirements of the Process Document
                        will apply to all JSRs when they next make a formal state-change
                        through the process</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
