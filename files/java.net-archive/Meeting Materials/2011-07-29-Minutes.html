<h2>Minutes</h2>
<p><em><strong>Review minutes from last meeting</strong></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Last week's minutes were approved. </li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Process discussion on Issue Tracking </strong></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>All open issues will be formally logged in the Issue Tracker. (If comments
  are submitted to the alias the owner will be asked to submit an issue.) </li>
  <li>Distinction between <em>Resolved</em> and <em>Closed</em>: we will mark
    issues as <em>Resolved</em> when we agree to make a fix (or to reject them)
    and <em>Closed</em> when we've actually implemented or rejected. </li>
  <li>Process for resolving issues: the owner comments the issue with proposed
    change, and either assigns to Eduardo for implementation or emails Patrick
    and asks him to do so. </li>
  <li>We will review newly-resolved issues at each WG meeting so that all can
    agree on the resolution. </li>
  <li> Items that will be postponed to  JSR2 will be copied to the JSR2 list
    if necessary and then closed.
    <ul>
      <li>We won't yet open a new  JIRA instance for JSR2 since this would require
        creating a new project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Review of open issues</strong></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>We reviewed all open issues, commenting, assigning, and marking as <em>Resolved</em> as
    necessary. </li>
  <li>Only one substantive issue requires further discussion - <strong><a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR348-4">JSR348-4</a></strong>.
    Patrick will open this up for discussion on the alias.</li>
  </ul>
<p><em><strong>Review of suggested changes to Standing Rules</strong></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>We reviewed two messages (from Roger Riggs and Sean Sheedy) that included
    comments on the Standing Rules</li>
  <li>Roger's message: Eduardo has already opened issues for most of the points
    Roger raised.  
    <ul>
      <li>Roger  also said &quot;The phrase <em>sustained objection</em> is used
        in a few places. 
        Does it mean <em>prolonged</em> or <em>persistent</em> or is there
        a motion and a vote? For example, lines (91, 97)</li>
      <li>Eduardo proposes  replacing &quot;consensus&quot; with the term &quot;rough consensus&quot;
        which is defined in an RFC, and then use this term throughout. </li>
      <li>Eduardo to open an issue and assign to himself.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sean's message expressed concerns about this language: &quot;All decisions,
    reached either through consensus or through a vote,&nbsp;are
    to be understood as decisions to advise the PMO.&quot;
    <ul>
      <li>We need to clarify when decisions are binding and when not. A new issue
      <a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR348-27">(JSR348-27)</a> was opened
      to track this. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Discussion on redline versions of the documents </strong></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Eduardo reported that the cumulative redline version of the document was
    becoming unreadable due to the volume of changes, and that he had therefore
    accepted all previous changes, redlining only those changes since the Early
  Draft review version of the document. </li>
  <li>We agreed that this is what we would submit to the EC for approval. </li>
  <li>We also agreed to produce a &quot;historical redline&quot;
    showing changes since 2.7. </li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Schedule, milestones, and next steps</strong></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>We have only two more meetings (the second is a full EC/EG meeting) before
    Public Review.</li>
  <li>We agreed to postpone next week's meeting from Wednesday to Friday (August
    5) to give us time to complete all proposed changes before the full EC/EG
    meeting on August 10.</li>
  <li>The Public Review will begin at midnight on August 12.</li>
</ul>
