<h2>Minutes</h2>
<p><em><strong>Review minutes from last meeting</strong></em></p>
<p>The minutes were approved.</p>
<p><em><strong>Review of open issues</strong></em></p>
<p>Patrick/Eduardo reported that the  issue tracker is working well. We agreed
  to continue to use it in preference to general email discussion for logging
  and discussing issues.</p>
<p>We reviewed the majority of the open issues, noting several for closure and
  others for additional action. (The results of our discussions were captured
  in the issues' comments rather than in these minutes.) </p>
<p>Patrick and Eduardo will work to clean up the open issues over the next few
  days. In the meantime, members are encouraged to review and comment on open
  issues. </p>
<p><em><strong>Preparation for full EC/EG meeting next week </strong></em></p>
<p>We agreed to publish another draft on Monday. This is what we will review
  during next Wednesday's EC/EG meeting, and which (hopefully) we will submit
  as the official Public Review draft. Public Review is scheduled to begin at
  midnight on August 12/13. </p>
<p>Mike will encourage EG members to review the current drafts, and to familiarize
  themselves with the Public Review drafts that will be published on Monday,
  so that they are prepared for Wednesday's meeting.</p>
