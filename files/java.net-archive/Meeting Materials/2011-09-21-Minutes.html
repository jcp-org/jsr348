<h2>Minutes</h2>
<p><em><strong>Review of Issues </strong></em></p>
<p>We reviewed all open issues with the exception of those recently filed (sometimes
  even during this meeting!) by Sean Sheedy. See the Issue Tracker for details.</p>
<p>We briefly discussed how to handle Sean Sheedy's recent issues and decided
  that many of them would have to be deferred due to lack of time. We did agree
  that we should attempt to implement those that are relatively simple (the &quot;low-hanging
  fruit.&quot;</p>
<p>Review and resolution is still in process - see the Issue Tracker for details.</p>
<p><em><strong>End-game </strong></em></p>
<p>We have only one more meeting before we must submit our Final Draft. Between
  now and then we will need to resolve or defer all outstanding issues.</p>
