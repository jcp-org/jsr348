<h3>Inactive JSRs</h3>
<p>In the context of a discussion on Inactive JSRs during the EC meeting Patrick
  Curran pointed out that this topic would be addressed in JCP.next. He reminded
  members that we propose to institute a series of<em> time-outs</em> so that
  JSRs that did not reach Early Draft Review within one year, Public Review
  within two years, or complete within three years would be subject to a <em>JSR
  Reconsideration Ballot</em>  and potentially shut down. John Rizzo and Bruno
  Souza suggested that three years is too long, and that the required milestones
  be tighter. Ben Evans pointed out that whether or not a JSR was really inactive
  depends on the amount of engineering and development work that is actually
  taking place. He suggested that some JSRs (for example, JSR 292) that appear
  to be inactive might actually be working hard. Patrick responded that the solution
  to this problem is to issu an Early Draft Review. He pointed out that it's
  OK for an EG to issue multiple EDRs. Members responded that this isn't necessarily
  widely known, and suggested that this should be publicized. (This has been
  added to the <a href="http://java.net/projects/jsr348/downloads/download/Working%20documents/AIs.html">AI
  list</a>.) </p>
<p>John Rizzo argued that there should be a limit on the number of EDRs. Patrick
  responded that the requirement that a JSR reach the next stage (Public Review)
  within a specified period would ensure this.</p>
<p>Patrick reminded members that the requirements of the new Process Document
  would not apply to existing JSRs, implying that the existing cleanup process
  would need to be continued for quite some time. </p>
<h3><strong>JSR approval ballot </strong></h3>
<p>Patrick reported the results of the JSR approval ballot. See the <a href="http://java.net/projects/jsr348/downloads/download/Meeting%20Materials/JSR348-update-060711.pdf">presentation</a> for
details. </p>
<h3><strong>Working style </strong></h3>
<p>Patrick presented the Working Style proposals from the Working Group. John
  Rizzo suggested that since EC members are automatically members of the Expert
  Group, we should require them to acknowledge that they have read the minutes
  of the WG and have followed the discussion, so as to guard against the possibility
  of &quot;surprises&quot; when the JSR came to a formal vote. Scott Jameson and others
  expressed concern at this suggestion, pointing out that every member company
  has its own way of seeking internal feedback and approval, and that the Working
  Group could not second-guess or try to define how this process would work.
  After a lively discussion we agreed to move on, expressing the hope that all
  Expert Group members would follow the activities of the Working Group, and
  would raise any concerns early, so that there would be no surprises during
  formal votes. </p>
<p>Edin Bestevic asked whether Oracle would be exempt from the suggestion that
  members &quot;disagree and commit&quot; where they have problems with a particular proposal.
  Patrick responded that as with all JSRs, the Spec Lead could not be forced
  to implement something that they believe runs contrary to their business interests.
  Either a consensus is reached, or the Working Group disbands and the JSR fails
  to progress (as with the previous attempt to modify the JSPA and Process Document
- JSR 306.) </p>
<p>The Expert Group then approved the Working Style as documented in the <a href="http://java.net/projects/jsr348/downloads/download/Meeting%20Materials/JSR348-update-060711.pdf">presentation</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Transparency plan </strong></h3>
<p>Patrick presented the Working Group's propsed Transparency Plan, as implemented
  in the <a href="http://java.net/projects/jsr348">java.net project</a>. Expert
  Group members approved the Transparency Plan as documented in the <a href="http://java.net/projects/jsr348/downloads/download/Meeting%20Materials/JSR348-update-060711.pdf">presentation</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Schedule</strong></h3>
<p>Patrick reviewed the schedule, pointing out the goal of completing before
  the October election. He noted that the schedule is very tight, and pointed
  out the need to modify the date of the August EC teleconference to align with
  the proposed schedule of reviews and ballots. Bruno Souza argued that if we
  miss the October deadline this wouldn't be a great problem.</p>
