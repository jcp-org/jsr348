<h2>Minutes</h2>
<p><em><strong>Review minutes from last meeting</strong></em></p>
<p>There were no comments on the minutes. We agreed that in future no formal
  approval would
  be needed.since the
  minutes are published immediately after the meeting. Any comments should be
  submitted by email, and will be incorporated as necessary. </p>
<p><em><strong>Resolve Maintenance Process (see mail thread on Experts alias) </strong></em></p>
<p>We spent almost the entire meeting on this topic. We eventually agreed that
  the approach laid out by Patrick in the message to the Experts alias seemed
  reasonable. Patrick agreed to rewrite his document for further discussion.
   He also agreed to clean up the open issues on this and the <em>Definition
   of Member</em> topic so that further discussion can take place through comments
  in the issue-tracker rather than on the mailing-list. </p>
<p>UPDATE: I've done the cleanup. Discussion on the <em>Definition of Member</em> topic
  should continue in <a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR348-86">JSR348-86:
  Improve clarity of Member definition</a>. Discussion of the <em>Maintenance
  Release</em>  process should continue in <a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR348-70">JSR
  348-70: Simplify Maintenance Review process by eliminating Item Exception Ballot
  and Change Log.</a></p>
<p><em><strong>Review definition of Member (see mail thread on Experts alias)</strong></em></p>
<p>We did not have time to discuss this topic. Patrick asked members to review
and comment the issue(s) in the issue-tracker. </p>
<p><em><strong>Review other open issues &ndash; if time permits </strong></em></p>
<p>We didn't get to this item. Patrick asked members to review
and comment the issues in the issue-tracker. </p>
<p><em><strong>Confirm and plan for WG meeting next week</strong></em></p>
<p>We agreed to meet as usual next Wednesday at 8:00 am</p>
<p><strong><em>Other business</em></strong></p>
<p>Patrick reported that there has been little external feedback since we went
  to Public Review. He reminded members to conduct internal reviews within their
  own companies/organizations soon, and to provide feedback in time for it to
  be evaluated and incorporated into our Proposed Final Draft. </p>
