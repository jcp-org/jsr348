<h2>Minutes</h2>
<p>WG members discussed the <em>Maintenance Release </em>proposal and approved it with
  minor changes. Patrick will now propose specific language changes
  to implement this proposal. </p>
<p>We then discussed the <em>categories of Membership</em> proposal, focusing
  primarily on the issue of <em>Member Associates</em> (people who are associated
  with an organization such as Apache or a JUG, but who are not employees, contractors,
  or officers  of
  that organization.) Can such people be authorized by the organization to offically
  represent it (thereby having an <em>Agent</em> relationship?) What
  if the organization is not even a legal entity? If they did become Agents,
  presumably they would be subject to the same restrictions as other Agents (no
  separate vote, cannot run for election as an individual.) Could they join an
  EG under the terms of the organization's JSPA? (Maybe if they formally agree
  to be bound by it?) We did agree that members of EGs must be bound by <strong>some</strong>  JSPA. </p>
<p>Patrick agreed to take legal advice on these questions. Assuming answers to
  these questions, we believe that we're close to resolving this matter. </p>
<p>Martijn reported that the LJC has held a meeting to seek feedback from its
  members. Apart from the JUG-member questions discussed above no major issues
  are expected to be submitted. However, he did point out that many developers
  don't understand the Process Document (it's too complicated and legalistic
  for them.) They would like a (non-normative) developer-friendly version of
  it. Patrick noted that we already have a non-normative Spec Lead Guide, and
  that perhaps the LJC could help by submitting material for this, and for a
  new Participants Guide which would be addressed to people who want to participate
  but do not intend to lead a JSR.</p>
<p>We did not have time to review any other issues. As always, this is a request
  to review and comment on them before the next meeting. </p>
<p>We discussed our schedule - <strong>neglecting to note that the
    formal Public Review Ballot starts next Tuesday, September 6!</strong> Patrick
    will send a reminder to the ECs. </p>
<p>We agreed to postpone next week's meeting until 
  Thursday or Friday, and to try for 90 minutes or two hours, to make allowance
  for the holiday weekend, and to give Patrick and Eduardo more time to incorporate
  changes into the document. Patrick will put up a Doodle poll to chose the date
  and time. At next week's meeting we will focus on our remaining issues, and
  on preparation for the following week's f2f meeting in New Jersey. </p>
