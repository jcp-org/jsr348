<a name="E"></a> <font size="5">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </font>
</p>
<p>
The international Java community develops and evolves Java&ocirc;
technology specifications using the Java Community Process (JCP). The
JCP produces high-quality specifications in "Internet time" using an
inclusive, consensus building approach that produces a specification, a
reference implementation (to prove the specification can be
implemented), and a technology compatibility kit (a suite of tests,
tools, and documentation that is used to test implementations for
compliance with the specification).
</p>
<p>
Experience has shown that the best way to produce a technology
specification is to gather a group of industry experts who have a deep
understanding of the technology in question and then have a strong
technical lead work with that group to create a first draft. Consensus
around the form and content of the draft is then built using an
iterative review process that allows an ever-widening audience to
review and comment on the document.
</p>
<p>
This version of the JCP was developed through the JCP by means of JSR
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">215</span> 306, led by Sun
and the combined Executive Committees as the expert
group.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>
</p>
<p>
An Executive Committee (EC) representing a cross-section of both major
stakeholders and other members of the Java community is responsible for
approving the passage of specifications through key points of the JCP
and for reconciling discrepancies between specifications and their
associated test suites. There are two ECs: one to oversee the Java
technologies for the desktop/server space (with responsibility for the
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2SE and J2EE</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java SE and Java EE</span> specifications)
and the other to oversee
the Java technologies for the consumer/embedded space (with
responsibility for the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> specification).<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>
</p>
<p>
There are four major steps in this version of the JCP:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p> <b>INITIATION</b>: A specification targeted at the
desktop/server or consumer/embedded space is initiated by community
member(s) and approved for development by the responsible EC. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <b>EARLY DRAFT</b>: A group of experts is formed to develop a
preliminary draft of the specification that both the community and the
public will then review. Anyone with an Internet connection can read
and comment on the draft. The expert group uses feedback from the
review to revise and refine the draft. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <b>PUBLIC DRAFT</b>: The draft goes out again for review by
the public. The expert group uses the feedback to further revise the
document. At the end of this review, the EC decides if the draft should
proceed. If approved by the EC, the leader of the expert group sees
that the reference implementation and its associated technology
compatibility kit are completed before sending the specification to the
responsible EC for final approval. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <b>MAINTENANCE</b>: The completed specification, reference
implementation, and technology compatibility kit are updated in
response to ongoing requests for clarification, interpretation,
enhancements, and revisions. The responsible EC can review all proposed
changes to the specification and indicate which ones can be carried out
immediately and which will require the specification to be revised by
an expert group. Challenges to one or more tests in a specification's
technology compatibility kit are ultimately decided by the responsible
EC if they cannot be otherwise resolved. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
<a name="F"></a> <font size="5">FUNDAMENTAL DEFINITIONS </font>
</p>
<p>
<b>Java Community Process (JCP)</b>: The formal process described in
this document for developing or revising Java technology
specifications.
</p>
<p>
<b>Java Community Process Member (Member)</b>: A company, organization,
or individual that has signed the JSPA and is abiding by its terms.
</p>
<p>
<b>Java Specification Participation Agreement (JSPA)</b>: A one-year
renewable agreement between Sun Microsystems and a company,
organization or individual that allows the latter entities to
participate in the Java Community Process.
</p>
<p>
<b>Individual Expert Participation Agreement (IEPA)</b>: An agreement
between Sun Microsystems and an individual that allows that individual
to serve on an Expert Group at the invitation of the Specification
Lead. There is no fee associated with the IEPA and it is valid until
the Expert Group disbands. The IEPA allows individual technical experts
who do not represent companies or organizations to participate on
Expert Groups.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Editor:] Strike IEPA definition?
Agreement no longer in use.</span><br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Executive Committee (EC)</b>: The Members who guide the evolution of
the Java technologies. The EC represents a cross-section of both major
stakeholders and other Members of the Java Community. Members must have
signed the EC acceptance letter in order to serve on the EC. The EC
Policies and Procedures are in Appendix A.
</p>
<p>
<b>Program Management Office (PMO)</b>: The group within Sun
Microsystems that is responsible for administering the JCP and chairing
the EC.
</p>
<p>
<b>Java Specification (Specification)</b>: A written specification for
some aspect of the Java technology. This includes the language, virtual
machine, Platform Editions, Profiles, and application programming
interfaces.
</p>
<p>
<b>Platform Edition Specification (Platform Edition)</b>: A
Specification that defines a baseline API set that provides a
foundation upon which applications, other APIs, and Profiles can be
built. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">There are
currently three Platform Edition Specifications: J2SE,
J2EE, and J2ME.</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">There are currently three Platform
Edition Specifications: Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME.</span><br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Profile Specification (Profile)</b>: A Specification that references
one of the Platform Edition Specifications and zero or more other JCP
Specifications (that are not already a part of a Platform Edition
Specification). APIs from the referenced Platform Edition must be
included according to the referencing rules set out in that Platform
Edition Specification. Other referenced specifications must be
referenced in their entirety.
</p>
<p>
<b>Reference Implementation (RI)</b>: The prototype or "proof of
concept" implementation of a Specification.
</p>
<p>
<b>Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)</b>: The suite of tests, tools,
and documentation that allows an organization to determine if its
implementation is compliant with the Specification.
</p>
<p>
<b>JCP Web Site</b>: The web site where anyone with an Internet
connection can stay informed about JCP activities, download draft and
final Specifications, and follow the progress of Specifications through
the JCP.
</p>
<p>
<b>JCP Specification Page (Spec Page)</b>: Each Specification approved
for development or revision will have a dedicated public web page
established on the JCP Web Site to contain a history of the passage of
the Specification through the JCP, including a record of the decisions,
actions, and votes taken by the EC with respect to the draft
Specification.

<font size="5">PROGRAM </font>
</p>
<p>
<a name="1"></a> <font size="5">1. INITIATE A NEW OR REVISED
SPECIFICATION </font>
</p>
<h3><a name="1.1"></a> 1.1 INITIATE A JAVA SPECIFICATION REQUEST </h3>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Java Specification Request (JSR)</b>: The
document submitted to the PMO by one or more Members to propose the
development of a new Specification or significant revision to an
existing Specification.
</blockquote>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Umbrella Java Specification Request (UJSR)</b>:
A JSR that defines or revises a Platform Edition or Profile
Specification. A UJSR proceeds through the JCP like any other JSR.
</blockquote>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Expert</b>: A Member representative <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">(or
an individual who has signed the IEPA)</span> who has expert knowledge
and is
an active practitioner in the technology covered by the JSR.&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Expert Group</b>: The group of Experts
who develop or make significant revisions to a Specification.
</blockquote>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Specification Lead (Spec Lead)</b>: The
Expert responsible for leading the effort to develop or make
significant revisions to a Specification and for completing the
associated Reference Implementation and Technology Compatibility Kit. A
Spec Lead (or the Spec Lead's host company or organization) must be a
Java Community Process Member.
</blockquote>
<p>
One or more Members can initiate a request to develop a new
Specification, or carry out a significant revision to an existing one,
by sending a JSR to the PMO. The JSR must use the template available at
the JCP Web Site. Any JSR under consideration can be withdrawn by its
submitter(s) without explanation at any time prior to the completion of
the JSR approval vote (see section 1.3) upon request by the
submitter(s) to the PMO.
</p>
<p>
The following is some of the information required to be included with
each JSR:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> the Members making the request (the
submitters), a Specification Lead, and the initial members of the
Expert Group. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> a description of the proposed
specification. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> the reason(s) for developing or
revising it. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> the primary Platform Edition, as
well as any consideration given to other Platform Editions. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> an estimated development schedule. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> any preexisting documents,
technology descriptions, or implementations that might be used as a
starting point. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> a transparency plan, which outlines the tools and techniques
that the Spec Lead will use, during the creation and development of the
specification, and for communicating the progress within the EG to
Community Members, EC Members and the public. The EC will expect the
Spec Lead to operate the JSR in accordance with this plan. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="1.1.1"></a> 1.1.1 REVISE EXISTING SPECIFICATIONS </h4>
<p>
Existing Specifications, along with their associated RIs and TCKs, are
maintained by a designated Maintenance Lead using the processes
described in section 4 of this document. Maintenance Leads (and their
host companies or organizations) are expected to assume long term
ownership of their Specifications, RIs, and TCKs with due respect of
the will of the Java Community Members with regard to evolution. This
means that Maintenance Leads will automatically be the Spec Leads for
all significant revisions to their Specifications going forward but
they will not have the exclusive right to decide when a significant
revision will take place. That will be decided by the EC in response to
a revision JSR that can be initiated by any Java Community Member (or
Members). The only provision is that the submitter(s) should make a
reasonable effort to get some of the members of the previous Expert
Group to join the revision effort.
</p>
<h4><a name="1.1.2"></a> 1.1.2 PROTECT THE INSTALLED BASE AND GUARD
AGAINST FRAGMENTATION </h4>
<p>
Changes to the Java programming language, the Java virtual machine
(JVM), the Java Native Interface (JNI), packages in the "java.*" space,
or other packages delivered as part of <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2SE</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java SE</span>, have the potential to
seriously disrupt the installed base if carried out inconsistently
across the Platform Editions. In order to protect the installed base,
any such changes can only be accepted and carried out within a UJSR for
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2SE</span> Java SE.
</p>
<p>
In order to guard against fragmentation, new Platform Edition
Specifications will not substantially duplicate existing Platform
Editions or Profiles.
</p>
<h4><a name="1.1.3"></a> 1.1.3 PROFILES AND API SPECIFICATIONS TARGET
CURRENT PLATFORM EDITIONS </h4>
<p>
All new or revised Specifications must be compatible with the most
recent versions of the targeted Platform Edition Specifications. In
order to achieve this, all UJSRs to define new Profile Specifications
or revise existing Profile Specifications must reference the latest
version of the Platform Edition Specification they are based upon.
</p>
<h4><a name="1.1.4"></a> 1.1.4 J2ME PROFILES AND J2ME BUILDING BLOCKS</h4>
<blockquote> <b>definition - <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> Java ME Building
Block (Building Block)</b>:
A subset of one or more APIs defined in the <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2SE or J2EE</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java SE or Java EE</span> Platform
Edition Specifications. The <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Platform Edition
Specification is a
collection of Building Blocks. <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Profile Specifications can
build up
desired functionality by combining new API sets with existing Building
Blocks.
</blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
J2ME</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Profiles
will normally be based upon the existing Java virtual
machine and language Specifications. When such Profiles also need to
include subsets of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2SE</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Java SE</span> and/or <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2EE</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java EE</span> functionality, they will
reference
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Building Blocks.
</p>
<p>
Building Blocks are created and revised within the UJSR for the <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Platform
Specification. It is likely that different <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Profiles will
require different <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2SE/J2EE</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Java SE and/or Java EE</span>
subsets. For example, different categories
of devices may need different subsets of the "java.net" package. In
order to accommodate this, no fundamental restrictions are placed upon
the number of times or ways in which <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2SE/J2EE</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java SE or Java EE</span> functionality
can be
packaged into <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Building Blocks.
</p>
<p>
Building Blocks can be proposed in a UJSR for the <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Specification.
However, it is recognized that the consumer and device marketplaces can
change very rapidly in comparison to the desktop and server
marketplaces. The definition of new Building Blocks (as well as the
revision of existing blocks) may need to be carried out very quickly in
order for some <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Profiles to keep up
with changing market needs. In
the interest of speed, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Building Blocks may
also be defined and
revised within the JCP Maintenance Cycle (see section 4.2) for the <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span>
Specification.
</p>
<p>
Expert Groups that need to quickly create or update a <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Building
Block should approach the Maintenance Lead for the <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Platform
Edition Specification with their requests. The <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Maintenance Lead,
after consultation with both the <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Expert Group and the
Maintenance
Lead(s) of the Platform Edition(s) the block is to be derived from, may
propose the new Building Block as part of a maintenance update to the <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> specification. Note that
the EC can require any Building Block
proposed as part of the Maintenance Cycle to be defined in a major
revision to the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Specification (see
section 4.2.2).
</p>
<p>
If the Maintenance Lead declines a Building Block request, the
requesting Expert Group has the options of initiating a UJSR for <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span>
(which may be time consuming) or creating the needed APIs in any
namespace not reserved for use by existing Platform Edition
Specifications.
</p>
<p>
In exceptional circumstances, the <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span> Specification may define <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span>
Building Blocks for use with special classes of devices that can only
implement subsets of the Java virtual machine or language
Specifications. Such Building Blocks can be defined and approved only
within a UJSR for <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">J2ME</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Java ME</span>. They cannot be
defined using the Maintenance
Cycle because proposals for Building Blocks for these special classes
of devices must be subject to the widest possible review.
</p>
<p>
<b>1.1.5 CONTINUED AVAILABILITY</b>
</p>
<p>
The technology that a JSR defines can be delivered as part of a Profile
or Platform Edition, it can be delivered stand-alone or both. Future
versions of the technology may be integrated into a Profile or a
Platform Edition while previous versions were not. The submitter of a
JSR will be required, via the JSR submission form, to indicate if it is
the submitter's goal to deliver the JSR's RI and TCK as part of a
Profile or Platform Edition, stand-alone or both. When delivering the
JSR's RI and TCK integrated into a Profile or Platform Edition and not
delivering these separately and where the RI and TCK of previous
versions were available separately, the submitter must state the
rationale. Also in this case the JSR Review (see section 1.2) will be 4
weeks instead of 14 days.
</p>
<p>
A JSR for a new version of an API that proposes to become part of a
Profile or Platform Edition and is considering discontinuing
stand-alone availability where the previous JSR for this API did not
indicate this plan, must make that proposal to discontinue stand-alone
availability one version ahead.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<b>1.1.6 PLATFORM INCLUSION</b>
</p>
<p>
JSRs that want to be considered to be included in the definition of a
Platform Edition or a Profile should describe this intent in the JSR's
submission. The final decision whether a specific JSR is included in a
Profile or a Platform Edition is made by the Spec Lead and Expert Group
of that Platform Edition JSR or Profile JSR, and confirmed by the EC
ballots on those JSRs. If the Platform Edition or Profile JSR turns
down the request for inclusion, then the JSR for the API will be
required to deliver a stand-alone RI and TCK.
</p>
<h3><a name="1.2"></a> 1.2 JSR REVIEW </h3>
<blockquote> <b>definition - JSR Review</b>: A 2 or 4 week period when
anyone with an Internet connection can review and comment on a new JSR.
</blockquote>
<blockquote> <b>definition - JSR Page</b>: Each initiated JSR will be
published on a public area of the JCP Web Site.
</blockquote>
<p>
When a JSR is received, the PMO will give it a tracking number, assign
the JSR to the appropriate EC (or both ECs if so requested by the
submitter), create its JSR Page, announce the proposed JSR to the
public, and begin JSR Review. Comments on the JSR should be sent to the
e-mail address listed on the JSR Page. All comments received will be
made available from the JSR Page and forwarded to the EC for its
consideration. Members who are interested in joining the Expert Group
(should the JSR be approved) should identify themselves by submitting a
nomination form to the PMO. As described by section 1.1.5 the review
period will be either 2 or 4 weeks.
</p>
<h4>1.2.1 EARLY WARNING AND FEEDBACK ON LICENSING TERMS FOR THE RI AND
TCK </h4>
<p>
The Spec Lead's company or organization is responsible for the
Reference Implementation (RI) and Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)
and its licensing under terms compatible with the licensing guidelines
established for use within the JCP. The Spec Lead will provide the EC
with the terms under which the RI and TCK will be licensed no later
than the start of JSR Review. EC members will provide feedback on the
terms as an indication of how the community might react as a whole to
the terms.
</p>
<h3><a name="1.3"></a>1.3 JSR APPROVAL BALLOT </h3>
<blockquote> <b>definition - JSR Approval Ballot</b>: The EC ballot
during the last 14 days of the JSR Review to determine if the JSR
should be approved.
</blockquote>
<p>
During JSR Review, EC members should review the JSR (with its proposed
Spec Lead and initial Expert Group), any comments and nominations
received, and cast their ballot to decide if the JSR should be
approved.
</p>
<blockquote> <b>definition - JSR Reconsideration Ballot</b>: The EC
ballot to determine if a revised JSR should be approved.
</blockquote>
<p>
If the JSR Approval Ballot fails, the PMO will send all EC comments to
the JSR submitter(s) who will have the option of revising the JSR and
resubmitting it to the PMO within 14 days. If a revised JSR is not
received in that time, the original EC decision will stand and the JSR
will be closed. If a revised JSR is received, the PMO will post it to
the JSR Page, announce the revised JSR to the public, and send it to
all EC members for a JSR Reconsideration Ballot. If that ballot fails,
the JSR will be closed.
</p>
<p>
<a name="2"></a> <font size="5">2. CREATE THE EARLY DRAFT </font>
</p>
<h3><a name="2.1"></a> 2.1 FORM THE EXPERT GROUP </h3>
<p>
When a JSR is approved, the PMO will notify the identified Spec Lead to
form the Expert Group. If the Member contributing the Spec Lead
withdraws from the Community before the JSR is approved, the PMO will
request the initial Expert Group to choose a replacement from among
themselves who is willing to take on the duties defined in this
document (including taking responsibility for the RI and TCK, working
towards the estimated schedule given in the JSR, and assuming the
position of Maintenance Lead as described in section 4).
</p>
<p>
There is no size limit on the Expert Group. The Spec Lead may add
additional Experts at any time provided the existing Expert Group is
consulted first. New members may be added, for example, to increase
diversity of opinion. A Spec Lead recruits new Experts by approaching
other Members directly and working with them to identify an expert and
bring him or her into the Expert Group. <span
 style="text-decoration: line-through;">Individual experts can be
brought into the Expert Group if they sign an IEPA.</span>
</p>
<h4><a name="2.1.1"></a> 2.1.1 FREEDOM OF WORKING STYLE </h4>
<p>
Each Expert Group is free to define and follow whatever working style
it finds most productive and appropriate as long as it is compatible
with the JCP. Use of the Internet is encouraged. E-mail exchanges on
mailing lists established for the use by the Expert Group, along with
conference calls and group meetings, have been used by past Expert
Groups to discuss and resolve issues raised as the draft evolves.
In-person group meetings are useful but they tend to slow down work
considerably due to the need to coordinate schedules.
</p>
<p>
While Spec Leads are free to operate Expert Groups in whatever style
they feel is most appropriate, they are encouraged to choose a style
that provides maximal transparency to the Expert Group, community, the
EC members and the public. The PMO provides Spec Leads with tools and
techniques for making the actions of their Expert Groups transparent,
and the EC members expect Spec Leads to carefully choose which tools
are best for their Expert Groups and commit to using them. Transparency
is valuable to everyone in the community, especially the Expert Group,
because it offers broader feedback to the group and helps build broader
support for the final spec.
</p>
<h4><a name="2.1.2"></a> 2.1.2 WITHDRAWAL OF AN EXPERT FROM THE EXPERT
GROUP </h4>
<p>
An Expert may withdraw from the Expert Group at any time. When this
happens, the Spec Lead may approach the Member who originally
contributed the Expert and work with that organization to find a
replacement. If no replacement is offered, the Spec Lead may recruit a
replacement from another Member if desired. If the departing Expert is
the Spec Lead, the Expert Group should choose one of its members as the
new Spec Lead provided he or she is willing to take on all of the
responsibilities defined in this document.
</p>
<h4><a name="2.1.3"></a> 2.1.3 UNCOOPERATIVE OR UNRESPONSIVE EXPERT
GROUP MEMBERS </h4>
<p>
There may be rare instances when members of the Expert Group feel that
one of their fellow Experts is not acting in ways that advance the work
of the Expert Group. These concerns should be brought to the attention
of the Spec Lead and/or the EC as quickly as possible so they may be
proactively addressed and resolved. The Expert Group members are
expected to make a reasonable effort to resolve any such issues among
themselves. If a 2/3 majority of the members of the Expert Group find
that a Spec Lead is being unresponsive, and the Spec Lead does not work
to resolve the situation in a timely manner, the EC may direct the PMO
to ask the Member who provided the Spec Lead to provide a replacement.
</p>
<h3><a name="2.2"></a> 2.2 WRITE THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE SPECIFICATION </h3>
<p>
The Expert Group should begin work by considering the requirements set
forth in the JSR, any contributed documents or technology descriptions,
comments received during JSR Review and, if this is a revision of an
existing Specification, the Change Log kept by the Maintenance Lead
(see section 4). Additional input can be obtained from discussions with
other Members, industry groups, software developers, end-users, and
academics. The goal is to define requirements and then write a draft
specification suitable for review by the Community and the public.
</p>
<p>
When the Expert Group decides that the first draft is ready for review,
the Specification Lead will send the draft, along with any additional
files required for review, to the PMO. The Specification Lead should
also suggest the length of the Early Draft Review period if the Expert
Group feels it should go beyond the minimum 30 days.
</p>
<h4>2.2.1 CONFIRMATION OF LICENSING TERMS FOR RI AND TCK </h4>
<p>
The Spec Lead's company or organization is responsible for the
Reference Implementation (RI) and Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)
and its licensing under terms compatible with the licensing guidelines
established for use within the JCP. The Spec Lead will provide the EC
with confirmation of the terms under which the RI and TCK will be
licensed at each review period. EC members will provide feedback on the
terms as an indication of how the community might react as a whole to
the terms.
</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote> <b>definition &ntilde; Early Draft Review</b>: A 30 to 90
day period, coexistent with Community Review, when the public review
and comment on the draft Specification.
</blockquote>
<p>
Refinement of the draft Specification begins when the PMO posts it to
the JCP Web Site and announces the start of Early Draft Review to all
of the Members and the public. Anyone with access to the Internet can
download and comment on the draft. The goal of Early Draft Review is to
get the draft Specification into a form suitable for Public Review as
quickly as possible by uncovering and correcting major problems with
the draft. Early Draft Review is an early access review, designed to
ideally take place when the specification still has some unresolved
issues. The public's participation in Early Draft Review is an
important part of the JCP. In the past, comments from the public have
raised fundamental architectural and technological issues that have
considerably improved some Specifications.
</p>
<p>
All comments from Members and the public should be sent to the e-mail
feedback address listed in the draft. The Spec Lead is responsible for
ensuring that all comments are read and considered. Members have a
right to receive a response to their comments. For simplicity, similar
comments may be combined and responded to as one.
</p>
<h4><a name="2.3.1"></a> 2.3.1 UPDATING THE DRAFT DURING EARLY DRAFT
REVIEW </h4>
<p>
If the Expert Group makes major revisions to the draft during Early
Draft Review, the Spec Lead should send the revised draft, along with a
synopsis of the changes, to the PMO. The PMO will notify Members of any
updated drafts and change synopses received and make them available for
download by Members and the public.
</p>
<p>
During Early Draft Review, EC members are strongly encouraged to have
one or more technical members of their organizations carry out a review
of the draft in order to uncover possible duplication of features or
services between the draft and other Specifications. EC members should
inform the Expert Group of any such discoveries using the Member e-mail
feedback address listed in the draft so they can be considered and
responded to like all Member comments. EC member feedback is important
to the Expert Group, and EC members are encouraged not to wait until
ballot periods to voice concerns and issues.
</p>
<p>
After the Early Draft Review period has ended, the Expert Group can
make any additional changes to the draft it deems necessary in response
to comments before submitting the draft to the PMO for Public Review.<br>

Approval Ballot, or does not begin Public Draft Review within 3 years
or has not posted a Final Release spec within 4 years, then a JSR
Renewal Ballot may be initiated at the request of a majority of the
relevant EC. The PMO will inform the Spec Lead and Expert Group of the
decision of the EC to hold this ballot and request that the Spec Lead
and Expert Group prepare a public statement to the EC. The JSR Renewal
Ballot
will start 30 days following the majority request. The JSR Renewal
Ballot is carried out for 7 days. If the JSR Renewal Ballot is
approved by the EC, then another renewal ballot cannot be initiated for
that JSR for an additional year.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

concerns raised by the EC and submit a revised version to the PMO. If a
revised JSR is not received by the end of the 30 days, the original
decision by the EC will stand and the JSR will be closed. If a revision
is received, then the PMO will forward it to the EC and initiate a JSR
Renewal Reconsideration Ballot. At the close of balloting, all comments
submitted by EC members with their ballots will be circulated to the
Expert Group by the PMO. If this ballot fails, the JSR will be closed
and the Expert Group will disband. If the JSR was a revision to an
existing Specification, the Spec Lead will resume the role of
Maintemance Lead of the current Specification (see section 4).</span><br>

<h3><a name="3.1"></a> 3.1 PUBLIC REVIEW </h3>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Public Review</b>: A 30 to 90 day period
when the public can review and comment on the draft Specification.
</blockquote>
<p>
Public Review begins when the PMO posts a new draft Specification on
the JCP Web Site and announces it to both Members and the public.
Anyone with access to the Internet can download and comment on the
draft.
</p>
<p>
The Spec Lead is responsible for ensuring that all public comments are
read and considered. If those comments result in revisions to the
draft, and those revisions result in major changes (in the opinion of
the Expert Group), then the Specification Lead will send an updated
draft (with synopsis of the changes) to the PMO at any time up until
the last 7 days of the review period (the draft is frozen during the
last 7 days of Public Review in order for the EC to complete their
Public Draft Specification Approval Ballot). The PMO will post both the
new draft and the change synopsis to the JCP Web Site and notify both
Members and the public.
</p>
<p>
EC members are strongly encouraged to have one or more technical
members of their organizations carry out a review of the draft early on
in Public Review, in order to uncover possible negative changes since
Early Draft Review. EC members should inform the Expert Group of any
such discoveries using the Member e-mail feedback address listed in the
draft so they can be considered and responded to during the review
period, like all Member comments. EC member feedback is important to
the Expert Group, and EC members are encouraged not to wait until
ballot periods to voice concerns and issues.
</p>
<h3>3.2 PUBLIC DRAFT SPECIFICATION APPROVAL BALLOT </h3>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Public Draft Specification Approval Ballot</b>
: The EC ballot to determine if a draft should proceed after Public
Review.
</blockquote>
<p>
The Public Draft Specification Approval Ballot is carried out during
the last 7 days of the Public Review. At the close of balloting, all
comments submitted by EC members with their ballots will be circulated
to the Expert Group by the PMO.
</p>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Public Draft Specification
Reconsideration Ballot</b> : The EC ballot to determine if a revised
draft should proceed after Public Review.
</blockquote>
<p>
If the Public Draft Specification Ballot fails, the Expert Group will
have 30 days to update the draft in response to the concerns raised by
the EC and submit a revised version to the PMO. If a revised draft is
not received by the end of the 30 days, the original decision by the EC
will stand and the JSR will be closed. If a revision is received, the
PMO will forward it to the EC and initiate a Public Draft Specification
Reconsideration Ballot. At the close of balloting, all comments
submitted by EC members with their ballots will be circulated to the
Expert Group by the PMO. If this ballot fails, the JSR will be closed
and the Expert Group will disband. If the JSR was a revision to an
existing Specification, the Spec Lead will resume the role of
Maintenance Lead of the current Specification (see section 4).
</p>
<h3><a name="3.2"></a> 3.3 PROPOSED FINAL DRAFT </h3>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Proposed Final Draft</b>: The version of
the draft Specification that will be used as the basis for the RI and
TCK.
</blockquote>
<p>
If the Public Draft Specification Approval Ballot (or reconsideration
ballot) is successful, the Expert Group will prepare the Proposed Final
Draft of the Specification by completing any revisions it deems
necessary in response to comments received. The Spec Lead will then
send the Proposed Final Draft to the PMO who will announce it to both
Members and the public and post it on the JCP Web Site for public
download.
</p>
<h4><a name="3.2.1"></a> 3.3.1 COMPLETE THE RI AND TCK </h4>
<p>
The Spec Lead is responsible for the completion of both the Reference
Implementation (RI) and Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK). JSRs which
are assigned to both ECs are required to deliver an RI and TCK that are
applicable to the J2ME environment and to the J2SE or J2EE environment.
This may require a separate RI and TCK for each environment. If the RI
and TCK uncover areas of the Specification that were under-defined,
incomplete, or ambiguous, the Spec Lead will work with the Expert Group
to correct those deficiencies and then send a revised Specification
(with synopsis of the changes) to the PMO. All such revisions and
change synopses received will be posted to the JCP Web Site and
announced to both Members and the public. The Expert Group will
continue to consider any further comments received during this time.
</p>
<h4><a name="3.2.2"></a> 3.3.2 ESTABLISH A FIRST-LEVEL TCK APPEALS
PROCESS </h4>
<blockquote> <b>definition - First-Level TCK Appeals Process</b> : The
process defined by the Spec Lead that allows <span lang="en-US">
implementers </span> of the Specification to appeal one or more tests
defined by the Specification's TCK.
</blockquote>
<p>
The Spec Lead is also responsible for establishing a clearly defined
First Level TCK Appeals Process to address challenges to the tests
contained in the TCK. This process must be described in the
documentation included in the TCK (see Section 4.3 for information on
the full TCK Appeals Process). Examples of First Level TCK Appeals
Process applicable to situations ranging from simple API Specifications
all the way up to Platform Edition Specifications can be found in the
TCK section of the JCP Web Site.

<blockquote> <b>definition - Final Approval Ballot</b>: The 14-day EC
ballot to approve the Final Draft along with its associated RI and TCK.
</blockquote>
<p>
When the Expert Group is satisfied that the TCK provides adequate test
coverage, the RI adequately implements the Specification, and the RI
passes the TCK, the Spec Lead will send the Final Draft of the
Specification to the PMO along with instructions on how EC members can
obtain the RI and TCK for evaluation. The PMO will circulate the
materials to the EC and initiate the Final Approval Ballot. At the
close of balloting, all EC comments will be sent to the Expert Group by
the PMO.
</p>
<p>
Each TCK submitted as part of the Final Draft must meet the following
requirements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p> Include all TCK documentation covering configuration and
execution of the TCK, definition and explanation of the First-level TCK
Appeals Process, and any other information needed to use the TCK (e.g.
Tools documentation). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Be accompanied by a test harness, scripts or other means to
automate the test execution and recording of results. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0.12in;"> Include a TCK Coverage Document
for the EC members to use in evaluating the sufficiency of the TCK.
This executive summary of the TCK should include an overview of the
documentation included in the TCK, description of means used to
validate the quality of the TCK, criteria used to measure TCK test
coverage of the Specification, test coverage numbers achieved, and
justification for the adequacy of TCK quality and its test coverage. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0.12in;"> Provide 100% signature test
coverage. These tests must ensure that all of the required API
signatures of the spec are completely implemented. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>
If the Final Approval Ballot fails, the Spec Lead will have 30 days to
revise the RI and/or TCK in response to any EC concerns. At the same
time, the Expert Group will have 30 days to revise the Final Draft in
response to any EC concerns and send it to the PMO.
</p>
<p>
If no responses are received by the end of the 30 days, the original
decision of the EC will stand, the PMO will close the JSR, and the
Expert Group will disband. If the JSR was a revision to an existing
Specification, the Spec Lead will resume the role of Maintenance Lead
of the current Specification (see section 4).
</p>
<p>
If a response is received, the PMO will circulate it to all EC members
for a Final Approval Reconsideration Ballot. At the close of balloting,
all ballot comments submitted by EC members will be circulated to the
Expert Group by the PMO. If the reconsideration ballot fails, the JSR
will be closed and the Expert Group will disband. If the JSR was a
revision to an existing Specification, the Spec Lead will resume the
role of Maintenance Lead of the current Specification.
</p>
<h3><a name="3.4"></a> 3.5 FINAL RELEASE </h3>
<p>
Specifications that are approved by the EC during the Final Approval
Ballot (or the reconsideration ballot) will be posted by the PMO on the

<a name="4"></a> <font size="5">4. MAINTENANCE </font>
</p>
<h3><a name="4.1"></a> 4.1 KEEP THE SPECIFICATION UP TO DATE </h3>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Maintenance Lead (ML)</b> : The Expert
responsible for maintaining the Specification.
</blockquote>
<p>
The Maintenance Lead is responsible for carrying out maintenance on the
Specification and dealing with errata by fielding requests for
clarification, interpretation, and enhancements to the Specification
from both Members and the public via an e-mail address listed in the
Specification. The ML will consider all requests and will decide how
and if the Specification should be updated in response. The ML will
typically be the Spec Lead from the Expert Group that developed the
Specification. The ML is not required to do all these tasks alone. The
ML may find it very helpful to recruit members of the Expert Group that
helped to develop the Specification to assist with the Maintenance
duties.
</p>
<h4><a name="4.1.1"></a> 4.1.1 THE MAINTENANCE LEAD MAKES A LONG TERM
COMMITMENT </h4>
<p>
The Maintenance Lead (and his or her host company or organization) is
expected to assume long term ownership of the Specification, RI, and
TCK with due respect of the will of the Java Community Members with
regard to evolution. This means that a Maintenance Lead will
automatically be the Spec Lead for all significant revisions to their
Specification going forward but he or she will not have the exclusive
right to decide when a significant revision will take place (see
section 1.1.1).
</p>
<h4><a name="4.1.2"></a> 4.1.2 RELINQUISHING OWNERSHIP </h4>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Dormant Specification (Dormant)</b> : A
Specification that does not have an identified Maintenance Lead. All
Specifications become Dormant at the end of their life cycles.
</blockquote>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Transfer Ballot</b>: The EC ballot to
approve transfer of ownership of a Specification, RI, and TCK from one
Member to another Member.
</blockquote>
<p>
If the ML decides to discontinue his or her work for whatever reason
(including discontinuing maintenance activities or declining to take on
the role of Spec Lead during a significant revision initiated by a JSR)
the ML should make a reasonable effort to locate another Member who is
willing to take on the task. If the ML fails to find a replacement, the
PMO will declare the Specification to be Dormant. No further
maintenance will be carried out on it until a new ML is identified and
ownership of the Specification, RI, and TCK is transferred to the new
ML's organization (subject to a successful Transfer ballot by the EC).
</p>
<h3><a name="4.2"></a> 4.2 THE MAINTENANCE CYCLE </h3>
<p>
The ML will review all comments, identify common themes, and arrange
with the PMO to make a list of frequently raised issues available from
the document's Spec Page. The ML is free to consult with the former
members of the Expert Group, or any other sources, for advice on how to
revise the Specification. All change items proposed by the ML will make
their way into the Specification by either the Minor Revision process
(described in section 4.2.1) or by a JSR.
</p>
<h4><a name="4.2.1"></a> 4.2.1 MINOR REVISION PROCESS </h4>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Minor Revision</b>: Minor changes made to
a Specification by the ML.
</blockquote>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Change Log</b>: An area accessible from
the Spec Page that lists all changes made to the Specification after
Final Release. There are three sections: PROPOSED (changes not yet made
to the Specification), ACCEPTED (changes made), and DEFERRED (change
items to be considered in a new JSR).
</blockquote>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Maintenance Review</b> : A period of at
least 30 days prior to finalization of a Minor Revision when Members
and the public consider and comment on the change items listed in the
PROPOSED section of the Change Log.
</blockquote>
<p>
The ML will arrange to have all change items placed into the PROPOSED
section of the Change Log and then send a request to the PMO to
initiate a Maintenance Review. The PMO will make a public announcement
and begin the review.
</p>
<p>
The ML may choose to modify one or more of the proposed changes based
on comments received during review. All comments will be available from
the Spec Page. At the end of Maintenance Review, the ML will <span
 style="font-style: italic;">through the posting of a Maintenance
Release</span> update the
Specification, document all revisions in the ACCEPTED section of the
Change Log, and delete the corresponding entries in the PROPOSED
section. All changes not incorporated into the Specification may be
either left in the PROPOSED section or moved to the DEFERRED section.
</p>
<h4><a name="4.2.2"></a> 4.2.2 THE EC MAY DEFER MINOR REVISION ITEMS </h4>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Item Exception Ballot</b> : The EC ballot
to determine whether or not to include specific change items in a Minor
Revision.
</blockquote>
<p>
During Maintenance Review an EC member may request that specific
proposed change items be deferred to the next JSR. Any such request
must be made to the PMO no later than 7 days before the close of
Maintenance Review. If requests are received, the PMO will circulate
the requests to all EC members and initiate an Item Exception Ballot
during the last 7 days of the review. At the close of Maintenance
Review, the PMO will post the ballot results to the Change Log. The ML
will place all proposed changes that were disapproved into the DEFERRED
section. The ML will need to initiate a JSR to carry out any of those
changes.
</p>
<h4><a name="4.2.3"></a> 4.2.3 KEEPING THE RI AND TCK SYNCHRONIZED WITH
THE SPECIFICATION </h4>
<p>
Whenever the Specification is updated, the ML is responsible for
reviewing the current RI and TCK to determine what revisions (if any)
are needed to keep the RI and TCK synchronized with the Specification.
The maintenance changes will be considered final when the RI and TCK
are synchronized with the Specification.
</p>
<h3><a name="4.3"></a> 4.3 THE TCK APPEALS PROCESS </h3>
<p>
As noted in section 3.2.2, the TCK documentation must identify and
specify a First-Level TCK Appeals Process by which challenges to the
TCK will be addressed. An
<span lang="en-US">implementer
</span>of a Specification can challenge a TCK test using the
First-Level TCK Appeals Process.
<span lang="en-US">Implementers
</span>who are not satisfied with a first level decision can appeal it
to the EC.
</p>
<h4><a name="4.3.1"></a> 4.3.1 APPEALING A FIRST-LEVEL DECISION TO THE
EC </h4>
<blockquote> <b>definition - Appeal Ballot</b> : The EC ballot to
override a first-level decision on a TCK test challenge.
</blockquote>
<p>
Implementers appeal a first-level decision to the EC by filing a
written request with the PMO using the online form available at the TCK
section of the JCP Web Site. The PMO will circulate the request to the
EC, along with any information received from the ML concerning the
rationale for the first-level decision, and initiate an Appeal Ballot.
</p>
<h3><a name="4.3.2"></a> 4.3.2 UPDATE THE RI TO MATCH THE TCK AND THE
SPECIFICATION </h3>
<p>
If the Appeal Ballot is successful, the ML will update the TCK and/or
the Specification in accordance with the EC decision and update the RI
if necessary.

sections A.4.2 and A.4.3.
</p>
<h4><a name="A.4.1"></a> A.4.1 RESIGNATION OF EC SEATS </h4>
<p>
Voting Members on the EC may resign their seats at any time during
their term.
</p>
<p>
Should one voting Member on the EC acquire a majority ownership of
another voting EC member, one of those members must resign his or her
seat by the effective date of the acquisition.
</p>
<p>
EC members who fail to remain Java Community Members forfeit their EC
seat.
</p>
<h4><a name="A.4.2"></a> A.4.2 SELECTION PROCESS FOR RATIFIED SEATS </h4>
<p>
Members are selected for the 10 Ratified Seats using a ratification
ballot that is carried out starting the first week of October of each
year. The table given at the end of section A.4 determines the number
of Ratified Seats up for ratification each year of the 3-year cycle.
</p>
<p>
A Ratified Seat that was vacated by resignation will be filled for the
remainder of its term by a ratification ballot that will be held no
later than two months after the resignation (unless the resignation is
less than three months before the next scheduled ratification ballot).
</p>
<p>
The ratification ballot is carried out as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> The PMO nominates Members to fill
the vacant Ratified Seats with due regard for balanced community and
regional representation. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> Eligible Members will vote to
ratify each nominee over a 14-day voting period. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> A nominee is ratified by a simple
majority of those who cast a vote. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> If one or more of the nominees are not ratified by the vote,
the PMO will nominate additional Members as needed and hold additional
ratification ballots until the vacant seats are filled. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
All Members are eligible to vote in a ratification ballot subject to
the provision that if a Member has majority-ownership of one or more
other Members, then that group of Members will collectively have 1
vote.
</p>
<h4><a name="A.4.3"></a> A.4.3 SELECTION PROCESS FOR ELECTED SEATS </h4>
<p>
Members are selected for the 5 Elected Seats using an election process
that is carried out starting the third week of October of each year.
The table given at the end of section A.4 determines the number of
Elected Seats up for election each year of the 3-year cycle.
</p>
<p>
An Elected Seat that was vacated by resignation will be filled for the
remainder of its term by an election ballot that will be held no later
than two months after the resignation (unless the resignation is less
than three months before the next yearly election).
</p>
<p>
The election ballot is carried out as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> Any Member may be nominated. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> The PMO will accept nominations
from the Community for a period of 14 days. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> Eligible Members may vote for as
many nominees as there are vacant Elected Seats over a 14-day voting
period. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> The nominees who receive the most
votes will fill the vacant Elected Seats. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Ties will be decided by drawing lots. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
All Members are eligible to vote in an election ballot subject to the
provision that if a Member has majority-ownership of one or more other
Members, then that group of Members will collectively have 1 vote.
