This is the public project for [JSR 348: Towards a new version of the Java Community Process](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=348), 
the first of three JSRs to modify the JCP's processes. 

This JSR will focus on relatively simple changes that can be implemented quickly (we hope to finish before October 2011.) 
The second JSR - which will be filed soon - will focus on merging the two Executive Committees into one,
while the third JSR will tackle more complex issues, including any necessary changes to the JSPA.

Since one of the main themes of JSR 348 is transparency, and since it will require that future JSRs be run in a transparent manner, 
the Expert Group has committed to running this JSR according to those requirements.

We will therefore discuss our business in public, publish all of our working materials and meeting minutes, and track issues in the open:

* To join the Observers' alias (to review and perhaps respond to Expert Group communications) go <a href="http://java.net/projects/jsr348/lists">here</a>. (You'll need a java.net login to subscribe.)
* Visit the <a href="http://java.net/projects/jsr348/forums/General">discussion forum</a> to comment on the work of the Expert Group (we'd prefer that you use this rather than the Observer alias, to keep mail traffic down.)
* For our meeting minutes and working documents, visit the <a href="http://java.net/projects/jsr348/pages/DocumentIndex">document archive</a>.
* We use the <a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR348">issue tracker</a> to record your comments and track issues.
